# While loops  
#for loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times 
#               you can iterate over a range string sequence etc
# for x in reversed(range (1, 11)): #counter weorks instead of x
#     print(x)

# print("happy new year")



# for x in range (1, 11, 2):
#     print(x)

#     print(x)

# for x in range (1, 21):
#     if x == 12:
#         continue
